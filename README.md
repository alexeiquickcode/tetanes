`TetaNES` is a cross-platform emulator for the Nintendo Entertainment System
(NES) released in Japan in 1983 and North America in 1986, written using
[Rust][]. It runs natively on Linux, macOS, Windows, and in a web browser with
[Web Assembly][].

It started as a personal curiosity that turned into a passion project. It is
still being actively developed with new features and improvements constantly
being added. It is a fairly accurate emulator that can play most NES titles.

`TetaNES` is also meant to showcase using Rust's performance, memory safety, and
fearless concurrency features in a large project. Features used in this project
include complex enums, traits, generics, matching, iterators, channels, and
threads.

`TetaNES` also compiles for the web! Try it out in your
[browser](http://lukeworks.tech/tetanes-web)!

## Getting Started

`TetaNES` runs on all major operating systems (Linux, macOS, Windows, and the
web). Installable binaries will be available when `1.0.0` is released, but for the
time being you can install with `cargo` which comes installed with [Rust][].

### Install

```sh
cargo install tetanes
```

This will install the latest version of the `TetaNES` binary to your `cargo` bin
directory located at either `$HOME/.cargo/bin/` on a Unix-like platform or
`%USERPROFILE%\.cargo\bin` on Windows.

### Directories

`TetaNES` stores files in various places, by default, depending on the file type
and various based on operating system. These can be overridden in the
configuration menu.

#### Configuration Preferences

- Linux: `$HOME/.config`
- macOS: `$HOME/Library/Application Support`
- Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\tetanes`
- Web: Does not currently support persisting configuration preferences.

#### Screenshots

- Linux, macOS, & Windows: `$HOME/Pictures`
- Web: Does not currently support saving screenshots.

#### Replay Recordings

- Linux, macOS, & Windows: `$HOME/Documents`
- Web: Does not currently support saving recordings.

#### Audio Recordings

- Linux, macOS, & Windows: `$HOME/Music`
- Web: Does not currently support saving recordings.

#### Battery-backed RAM, save states, and logs

- Linux: `$HOME/.local/share/tetanes`
- macOS: `$HOME/Library/Application Support/tetanes`
- Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\tetanes`
- Web: Does not currently support save states.

### Powerup State

The original NES hardware had semi-random contents located in RAM upon power-up
and several games made use of this to seed their Random Number Generators
(RNGs). By default, `TetaNES` honors the original hardware and emulates
randomized powerup RAM state. This shows up in several games such as `Final
Fantasy`, `River City Ransom`, and `Impossible Mission II`, amongst others. Not
emulating this would make these games seem deterministic when they weren't
intended to be.

If you would like `TetaNES` to provide fully deterministic emulated power-up
state, you'll need to change the `ram_state` setting in the configuration menu
and trigger a power-cycle or use the `-m`/`--ram_state` flag from the command
line.

### Building/Running

To build/run `TetaNES`, you'll need a nightly version of the compiler and run
`cargo build` or `cargo build --release` (if you want better framerates).

To run the web version, you'll also need the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target and
[trunk](https://trunkrs.dev/) installed:

```sh
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
trunk serve --release
```

Unit and integration tests can be run with `cargo test`. There are also several
test roms that can be run to test various capabilities of the emulator. They are
all located in the `tetanes-core/tests_roms/` directory.

Run them in a similar way you would run a game. e.g.

```sh
cargo run --release tetanes-core/test_roms/cpu/nestest.nes
```

## Features

### Crate Feature Flags

- **cycle-accurate** - Enables cycle-accurate emulation. More CPU intensive, but
  supports a wider range of games requiring precise timing. Disabling may
  improve performance on lower-end machines. Enabled by default.
- **profiling** - Enables [puffin](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/puffin)
  profiling.

### Debugging

There are built-in debugging tools that allow you to monitor game state and step
through CPU instructions manually. See the `Controls` section for more on
keybindings.

The default debugger screen provides CPU information such as the status of the
CPU register flags, Program Counter, Stack, PPU information, and the
previous/upcoming CPU instructions.

The Nametable Viewer displays the current Nametables in PPU memory and allows
you to scroll up/down to change the debug scanline at which the nametable is
read. Some games swap out nametables mid-frame like Super Mario Bros 3.

The PPU Viewer shows the current sprite and palettes loaded. You can also scroll
up/down in a similar manner to the Nametable Viewer.

Additional logging can be set by setting the `RUST_LOG` environment variable and
setting it to one of `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn` or `error` prior to
building the binary. e.g. `RUST_LOG=debug cargo build --release`

### Troubleshooting

If you get an error running a ROM that's using the supported Mapper list above,
it could be a corrupted or incompatible ROM format. If you're unsure which games
use which mappers, see <http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/>. Trying other
versions of the same game from different sources sometimes resolves the issue.

If you get some other error when trying to start a game that previously
worked, try removing any saved states from the directories listed above to
ensure it's not an incompatible savestate file causing the issue.

If you encounter any shortcuts not working, ensure your operating system does
not have a binding for it that is overriding it. macOS specifically has many
things bound to `Ctrl-*`.

If an an issue is not already created, please use the [github issue tracker][]
to create it. A good guideline for what to include is:

- The game experiencing the issue (e.g. `Super Mario Bros 3`). Please don't
  include any download links or ROM attachments.
- Operating system and version (e.g. Windows 7, macOS Mojave 10.14.6, etc)
- What you were doing when the error happened
- A description of the error and what happeneed
- Any screenshots or console output
- Any related errors or logs

When using the web version in the browser, also include:

- Web browser and version (e.g. Chrome 77.0.3865)

Implementation was inspiried by several amazing NES projects, without which I
would not have been able to understand or digest all the information on the NES
wiki.

I also couldn't have gotten this far without the amazing people over on the
[NES Dev Forums](http://forums.nesdev.com/):

- [blargg](http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=17) for
  all his amazing [test roms](https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Emulator_tests)

Also, a huge shout out to
[OneLoneCoder](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/) for his
[NES](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcNES) and
[olcPixelGameEngine](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine)
series as those helped a ton in some recent refactorings.
